# DuelForts
Duel forts is a two player duel game, where each player tries to grow
their own tower while trying to hinder the other ones growth.

This game was done as a part of a small 24-hour gamejam held in an island.

## Requirements
* Lua (5.3.4 and 5.2.4 tested)
* LÃ¶ve (11.1)

(Tested with debian, mint and arch distributions)
## Gameplay
Player take turns picking from five random cards, giving different effects 
from expanding their options to limiting their opponents, growing their tower or
lowering the opponents or even getting semi-permanent buffs to help them.

Players have a pool of money that limits their options for moves, which grows
each turn and is consumed with picking cards. Player have the option to skip
their turn, allowing them to play stronger cards at later turns. 

The game continues until a player has reached a height of 100 or a player's
tower's height is 0.

*Due to some peoples aversion to cards as abstract objects, 
it might help to imagine the choices as cylinders.*
